# Physical Verification using SKYWater 130nm\


## What this workshop provides:

This workshop aims to provide a thorough understanding of the Physical Verification methodology using Magic, NetGen, and OpenLane Flow in order to be able to correct the various issues that arise during the design cycle as Design Rule Check (DRC) or Layout vs Schematic (LVS) violations. We also go into great detail on the Sky130 Process Design Kit (PDK) over the course of 5 days. Every topic in the course had challenging labs that were completed on the VSD-IAT platform on the Sky130 PDK.
